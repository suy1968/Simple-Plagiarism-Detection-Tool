Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights
from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.
Data science provides meaningful information based on large amounts of complex data or big data. Data science, or data-driven science, combines 
different fields of work in statistics and computation to interpret data for decision-making purposes.
