Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights
from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

This is an entry limit that not many students can pass. They got fed up with statistics, or coding, or too many business decisions, and quit.
